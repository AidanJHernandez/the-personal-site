    <p>I am, as of March 2025, a sixteen year old guy who's passion mainly delves within the realm of art, including physical and voice performance, drawing, writing, the works! And to accompany that, I've taken on computer science as my major now, and possibly for college in the future.</p>
    <p>Why computere science for art?</p>
    <p>To put simply, you can do a lot with computers with a lot of imagination.</p>
